### About me
My name is Jayoo Hwang, and my two favorite things to do are reading machine learning research papers and competing in Kaggle competitions. This site is a collection of interesting papers that I have read in the last few months, mainly focusing on recently released works. LLMs are my primary research interest, especially augmented LLMs, LLM reasoning, AI agents, efficient models, and multimodal AI.
